# Information Visualization Project

This is an university project where we performed an **Explorartory Data Analysis** on the Romanian weather registered during 2011-2021.

The data has been collected using a *Node.js* script by performing multiple requests to the public [*Visual Crossing Weather API*](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api), addressing 41 counties of Romania with respect to 132 months.

You can find the dataset with a few mentions on [*Kaggle*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/acatalin14/romania-weather-visual-crossing-weather), more details about its structure being available at [*Weather Data Documentation*](https://www.visualcrossing.com/resources/documentation/weather-data/weather-data-documentation/).

In this **EDA** you will find a diversity of static and interactive plots (*e.g.* violins, lollipops, piecharts, maps *etc.*), each of them being able to depict different aspects of the weather observed in this country.

The final result of this **R** project can be found at *project_final_version.html*
